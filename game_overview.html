					<h1>Game Overview</h1>
					<img src="images/moon-landing.jpg" alt="">
					<h4>The Starship of Doom</h4>
					<p>
					The game is designed as a multi-player fighting game with an aim at taking down enemies and eventually defeating other players. Designed with 8 levels the player fights against a wave of enemies in each level
					until the boss appears which the player has to defeat before progressing to the next level. By defeating the boss the player acquires their unique power and can be picked to be used for the subsequent levels. These power 
					ups allow the player to stratergise and tackle each challenge differently. By the time the player gets to level 9 all boss levels have been complete and it is an all out battle against the other player to become champion. The game is 
					set in a starfield environment and the enemies are mainly made up of aliens and living enemies.
					</p>
					<h1>Story</h1>
					<p>
					A strange anomoly has been detected in the Alpha Carina System. Two reconnaissance officers have been sent to investigate but it seems they aren't the only ones interested...
					After a run in with a disbanded federation faction, the pilots start to think there might be something more to this anomoly than meets the eye. With their trusty starships the pilots work
					together to battle a mysterious oncoming threat, but as the saying goes, keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.

					<h4>The Starship of Doom</h4>
					<p>Game is designed as a multi-player fighting game with an aim at taking down enemies and eventually defeating other players. Designed with 5 levels the player fights against a wave of enemies in each level until the boss appears which the player has to defeat before progressing to the next level. By defeating the boss the player has the chance to pickup the unique power that the boss drops upon defeat. These power ups allow the player to fight better in the next level. By the time the player gets to level 5 all boss levels have been complete and it is an all out battle against the other player to become champion. The game is set in a starfield environment and the enemies are mainly made up of aliens and living enemies.</p>

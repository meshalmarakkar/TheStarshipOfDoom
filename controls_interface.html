					<h1>Controls & Interface</h1>
					<h2>Controls</h2>
					<p>
					Controls were kept realtively simple to allow the player to focus on the fast paced, frantic gameplay. The commonly used movement controls WASD were chosen to maneuver the player around the screen. 
					<br />Also well used, the spacebar will allow the player to fire their primary gun. This can be held to continously fire, however it is restricted to the preset fire rate; or depending on the upgrade equiped.
					<br />Pressing the 'C' key will allow the user to shoot a homing missile at the other player. This is unlocked at the last level where the objective is to kill the other. Keeping this close to the movement controls makes it easy to access for the player.
					<br />To navigate the menus, users simply have to move the mouse and click on the necessary buttons to progress. They are displayed on screen.

					<h2>UI</h2>
					<p>
					The UI is fairly simple to prevent overcrowding the screen. Both players lives are indicated in the top left and right corners, with slightly transparent ships indicating how many lives they have each.
					<br />A score is displayed at the top of the screen also. Players get points based on kills, which differ depending on the enemy type they kill, the stronger the enemy, the more points earned.

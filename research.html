					<br /><br /><br />Space Invaders - The Starship of Doom's foundation draws inspiration from the classic game 'Space Invaders'. The core levels involve several rows of enemies who move side to side meanwhile firing at the player. The aim is to defeat all of the oncoming enemies without being hit by their return fire. We took this idea and expanded on it, introducing new features and more detailed graphics.
					<br /><br />Galaga  - Another classic video game which influened our project is 'Galaga'. Very similar to space invaders, galga expands on the design by inrtoducing more detailed enemies and player sprites. The look of our game uses this simple art style, with various player and enemy sprites. In addidtion to what was inspired by galaga, a multiplayer aspect was added to the game, allowing two players to play together over the internet.
					<br /><br />Mega Man - A key feature included within our game is the ability to collect different power-up abilities after defeating a boss. Similar to gameplay in 'Mega Man', these abilities are relative to the boss the player has to defeat beforehand. These abilities can then be used to the players benefit in the remainder of the game. To expand upon this, players battle each other in the final level, with these unique power-ups making each final battle different.
					<br /><br />Splinter Cell Conviction - Although 'Splinter Cell Conviction' is an entirely different game from The Starship of Doom, there is a pivotal gameplay feature we adopted. In the final level of 'Splinter Cell Conviction' the two players who have been working together throughout the game suddnely have to fight against each other. This plot twist adds an interesting dynamic to our game, making it much more engaging to play.

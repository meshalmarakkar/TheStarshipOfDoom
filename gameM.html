					<h1>The Starship of Doom</h1>
					<p>The game is designed as a multi-player fighting game with an aim at taking down enemies and eventually defeating other players. Designed with 8 levels the player fights against a wave of enemies in each level
					until the boss appears which the player has to defeat before progressing to the next level. By defeating the boss the player acquires their unique power and can be picked to be used for the subsequent levels. These power 
					ups allow the player to stratergise and tackle each challenge differently. By the time the player gets to level 9 all boss levels have been complete and it is an all out battle against the other player to become champion. The game is 
					set in a starfield environment and the enemies are mainly made up of aliens and living enemies.</p>
